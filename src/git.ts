/**
 * The Git integration: everything Hearth knows about the
 * [obsidian-git](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git) community plugin.
 *
 * The rule here is the same one the Dataview, Datacore and Omnisearch modules
 * follow: **Hearth never does the work itself.** It does not shell out to
 * `git`, it does not bundle a git implementation, and it does not read
 * `.git/`. Every operation the card offers is a call into the running
 * obsidian-git plugin instance, so whichever backend the user has configured
 * (`SimpleGit` on desktop, `isomorphic-git` on mobile), whichever remote,
 * credentials, commit-message template, submodule and line-author settings they
 * have — all of it applies exactly as it does everywhere else in that plugin.
 * The card is a window onto obsidian-git, not a second implementation of it.
 *
 * Two consequences shape this file:
 *
 * 1. **Everything is optional.** obsidian-git exposes no versioned `api`
 *    object the way Omnisearch and Datacore do; what Hearth calls are the
 *    plugin instance's own public members. They are stable in practice (its
 *    own commands and views call the same ones) but they are not a contract,
 *    so every member is declared optional and every call site checks for the
 *    function before using it. A build of obsidian-git that renamed something
 *    disables one button; it never throws inside a dashboard render.
 * 2. **Writes go through obsidian-git's own queue.** The plugin serializes
 *    every repo-touching operation on `promiseQueue` so an automatic backup
 *    can't interleave with a manual commit. Hearth pushes its actions onto the
 *    same queue rather than calling the methods directly, which is why a card
 *    button behaves identically to the matching command in the palette —
 *    including its error reporting, which `promiseQueue` routes to the
 *    plugin's own `displayError`.
 *
 * The pure helpers at the bottom (status classification, commit formatting)
 * carry no Obsidian dependency and are unit-tested in `test/git.test.ts`.
